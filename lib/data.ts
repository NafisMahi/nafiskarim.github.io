    description:
      "Developed a deep learning model to predict COVID-19 cases, incorporating factors like vaccination rates and hospital admissions often overlooked in traditional models. The fusion-type network architecture combined channel-wise and global convolution with recurrent networks to capture complex time series dependencies. Tested on US and UK datasets, the model outperformed state-of-the-art methods, emphasizing the impact of vaccination on controlling case spread.",
